# Change Log for Tableau Hyper Management package

## Version 1.5.1 release on 2020-05-29
- added an extra verification for the scenario when at least one of the source files is newer than destination "overwrite" decision will be stronger than given "create" (safer to data accuracy).

## Version 1.5.0 release on 2020-05-26
- extended functionality and now input file and/or output file are aware of Calculated Date expressions, making possible this way to use dynamic name interpreted at run time;
- added "create" as option for "policy-to-handle-hyper-file" input parameter that allows skipping recreating "hyper" file if already exists;
- improved feedback. 

## Version 1.4.9 release on 2020-05-19
- bug fixes on internal code structure.

## Version 1.4.8 release on 2020-05-17
- extended the sql input parameter to be used in conjunction with Read action, this way a user customized query can be used to extract partial data (besides existing full extract one)
- few internal code and localization messages enhancements and corrections.

## Version 1.4.7 release on 2020-05-17
- added a data remove feature from Tableau Extract file (Hyper format) by extending one of the input parameters and add an additional one to have the ability to specify a custom SQL to remove data based on customer needs.

## Version 1.4.6 release on 2020-05-17
- added additional input parameter to have be able to create (or recreate if hyper file already exists) new hyper file and add data from input files OR just use existing hyper file and append data from input files (can be very useful in case of large data sets).  

## Version 1.4.5 release on 2020-05-15
- added support for 2 additional file format in a combination with output file format = Hyper;
- few additional file formats combination checks to avoid runtime errors;
- improved localized feedback captured in log files.

## Version 1.4.2 release on 2020-05-12
- supported files are now used internally for validation purposes which makes code more maintainable if and when new file types will be implemented with changes in fewer places.

## Version 1.4.1 release on 2020-05-12
- added support for Parquet file format (full coverage: both input and output).

## Version 1.4.0 release on 2020-05-12
- extended support for Pickle and JSON file format which now can be used as input files in combination with Tableau Extract (Hyper) as output file;
- field type timestamp properly recognized;
- added a matrix of file combination in documentation (should make usage much clearer).
